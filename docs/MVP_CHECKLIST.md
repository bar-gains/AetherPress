## Phase 1: MVP – Launching the Core Experience

### 1. User Experience: Prompt to Initial Draft Generation

**Goal:** Enable users to bring an idea into a working draft quickly.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **Prompt Input Functionality:**  
  - [ ] The UI displays a clean, simple prompt input field that accepts natural language instructions (e.g., "a short ebook of calming nature poems with watercolor backgrounds").
  - [ ] There are no restrictions that hinder diverse textual inputs.
  
- [ ] **Response Time:**  
  - [ ] From prompt submission to the generation of a complete eBook draft, the process must complete within 30 seconds on average under typical load conditions.
  
- [ ] **Draft Quality:**  
  - [ ] The generated draft must integrally combine relevant text, evocative images, and an appealing layout that closely resembles the benchmark quality ("Winter Poems Vol. I").
  - [ ] Visual and textual elements must conform to a professional and polished standard.
  
- [ ] **Live Preview & PDF Export:**  
  - [ ] A dynamic, embedded live preview accurately reflects the generated draft.
  - [ ] The exportable PDF must match this live preview in layout, quality, and content fidelity.

### 2. Core Engine Components: From Prompt to Assembled eBook

#### A. Prompt Engine

**Goal:** Correctly parse user input for themes, content types, styles, and layout cues.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] The prompt engine accurately extracts key parameters from natural language input with an error rate under 2% on commonly used phrases.
- [ ] Edge-case inputs (e.g., ambiguous or multi-part instructions) are either correctly parsed or produce clear error messages for user adjustment.

#### B. AI Orchestrator

**Goal:** Seamlessly delegate tasks to specialized agents while managing the workflow efficiently.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] The orchestrator successfully delegates tasks to the AI Content Agent, AI Image Agent, Layout Engine, and Assembly Engine.
- [ ] Workflow execution must reflect smooth error handling, with an overall failure rate below 2%.

#### C. AI Content & Image Agents

**Goal:** Generate content and images that align with the provided prompt and context.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **AI Content Agent:**  
  - [ ] Retrieves and integrates public domain texts (e.g., poems) that match the prompt’s theme.
  - [ ] The selected content is contextually relevant and blends naturally with the layout.
  
- [ ] **AI Image Agent:**  
  - [ ] Generates unique, high-resolution images that are evocative and consistent with the overall theme.
  - [ ] Images must meet designated resolution and aesthetic standards ensuring professional-grade visual appeal.

#### D. Layout & Assembly Engines

**Goal:** Automatically arrange content and images into a cohesive, visually pleasing eBook draft.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **Layout Engine:**  
  - [ ] Automatically applies a default template that ensures text readability over images.
  - [ ] Text and images are positioned according to established design best practices.
  
- [ ] **Assembly Engine:**  
  - [ ] Correctly sequences pages, auto-generates a cover, and builds an accurate table of contents.
  - [ ] The final book structure must be consistent with the live preview, with no mismatches in page order or content placement.

### 3. Overall System and Integration Testing

**Goal:** Validate the end-to-end workflow and system performance for the MVP release.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **Integrated Workflow:**  
  - [ ] End-to-end testing confirms that prompt submission, AI processing, draft generation, live preview, and PDF export function cohesively.
  
- [ ] **Performance Metrics:**  
  - [ ] Each module (prompt engine, orchestrator, content/image agents, layout, and assembly) meets the specified response times and quality benchmarks.
  
- [ ] **Usability Testing:**  
  - [ ] Novice users can complete the process in a streamlined manner with minimal guidance.
  - [ ] User feedback from test sessions is positive with no significant friction points detected.

## Additional Verification Points

- [ ] **Error Handling:**  
  - [ ] The system provides clear, actionable feedback when encountering invalid inputs or processing errors without crashing.
  
- [ ] **Documentation & Tooltips:**  
  - [ ] Detailed support documentation and tooltips are available to guide users through prompt input and dashboard functionalities.
  
- [ ] **Security & Data Integrity:**  
  - [ ] User data is handled securely during session operations, with no persistent storage of sensitive inputs.

## Further Considerations

Automated Test Integration: Over time, integrate these checklist items into your automated testing pipelines to ensure sustained quality through continuous integration.

Post-MVP Review: Plan for a user feedback session immediately after MVP deployment to gather additional tweak suggestions for subsequent roadmap phases.

Scalability Readiness: Although focused on the MVP, keep an eye on scalability test results to preemptively address potential performance bottlenecks.


This comprehensive MVP checklist is designed to align development, testing, and quality assurance efforts, ensuring the AetherPress MVP truly captures the intended magic of effortlessly turning ideas into visually impactful eBooks.

## Sign-Off

Each checklist item must be verified and signed off by the designated QA team lead before the MVP release. This ensures that the AetherPress MVP meets our stringent goals of speed, quality, and intuitive design.

*This checklist is a living document and should be revisited and updated as new insights from user testing and development progress dictate additional refinements.*
