## Vision

AetherPress is the magic wand for creating visually stunning, graphically rich eBooks—transforming simple ideas into polished masterpieces in minutes. By merging effortless AI generation with intuitive, precise controls, we aim to empower creators lacking deep design expertise to achieve professional-grade output.

## Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1: MVP – Launching the Core Experience

**Goal:** Enable users to bring an idea into a working draft quickly.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- A user can enter a natural language prompt (e.g., "a short ebook of calming nature poems with watercolor backgrounds") and receive a complete draft within 30 seconds.  
- The generated draft includes integrated text, evocative images, and an appealing layout that adheres closely to our benchmark quality ("Winter Poems Vol. I").  
- Both an embedded live preview and an exportable PDF match the above quality standards.

**Goal:** Build essential engine components for end-to-end draft generation.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- The **Prompt Engine** accurately parses user input, extracting themes, content types, and design cues.  
- The **AI Orchestrator** successfully delegates tasks to specialized agents (Content, Image, Layout, Assembly) with error rates under 2%.  
- The **AI Content Agent** and **AI Image Agent** generate contextually relevant text and images with high fidelity.  
- The **Layout Engine** and **Assembly Engine** seamlessly combine all elements into a cohesive, aesthetically pleasing draft.

### Phase 2: Refinement & Customization

**Goal:** Empower users to perfect every detail of their eBook through modular and intuitive overrides.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Users have access to a **Modular Dashboard** where each module (Content, Images, Layout, Settings, Structure) is distinct and editable.  
- Any change in a module, such as swapping an image or tweaking text layout, is reflected in the live preview within 2 seconds.  
- Overrides are non-destructive and reversible, ensuring that adjustments in one module do not adversely affect others.

**Goal:** Enhance user control while maintaining speed and simplicity.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- The interface flow requires no more than 3 clicks to make common tweaks (such as image regeneration or text repositioning).  
- Usability tests confirm that even novice users can easily access and understand modular controls.  
- A robust undo/redo mechanism is available to revert any change without penalty.

### Phase 3: Performance & Quality Enhancements

**Goal:** Optimize system performance for rapid generation and iterative refinement.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- The entire initial generation process consistently completes in under 30 seconds under typical load conditions.  
- Live preview updates occur in near real-time (within 2 seconds) even during intensive rewriting or image updates.  
- The PDF export process generates high-fidelity documents in under 15 seconds per project.

**Goal:** Ensure the exported output consistently mirrors the live preview in quality and layout.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Automated tests verify that the exported PDF structurally and visually aligns with the on-screen preview in 99% of cases.  
- Quality assurance benchmarks show less than a 2% error rate in layout rendering or content placement.  
- System stability is maintained with uptime above 99% during peak usage.

### Phase 4: Extended Features & Future Enhancements

**Goal:** Integrate additional creative features and collaborative tools to extend functionality.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Expanded content and image libraries are integrated, including AI-based suggestions and user-upload options, with a seamless user experience.  
- Cloud-based storage and collaborative editing features work reliably, with real-time synchronization between multiple users.  
- Multi-format export options (such as ePUB and HTML) are available and produce outputs that match the preview's quality and design.

**Goal:** Innovate continuously based on user feedback and emerging design trends.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- A feedback collection mechanism is in place to monitor user satisfaction and identify improvement areas post-launch.  
- Bi-annual review cycles are implemented to incorporate emerging AI, design, and usability trends into the product roadmap.  
- Prototypes of advanced creative functions (e.g., AI-driven layout suggestions and dynamic theme variations) are developed and tested with early adopters.

## Guiding Principles

- **Speed to Wow:** Deliver instant visual impact through rapid eBook draft generation.
- **Quality by Default:** Ensure all default outputs adhere to or exceed professional benchmarks.
- **Control without Complexity:** Provide intuitive, modular interfaces that allow deep customization without overwhelming users.
- **AI as Partner:** Leverage AI to augment creativity and efficiency while preserving the user’s creative judgment.

*This roadmap is a living document. As we gather user feedback and new insights on AI and design capabilities, we will iterate and evolve our approach to transform eBook creation into an artful and seamless experience.*

## Additional Thoughts

- Timeline Integration: As outlines become more concrete, consider assigning deadlines (e.g., Q3 2024 for the MVP) to each phase to track progress more effectively.

- User-Centered Testing: Incorporate user testing checkpoints to validate that acceptance criteria are met and to capture insights for continuous improvement.

- Scalability: Future updates might also outline performance metrics for scalability as the user base grows, such as load testing benchmarks for simultaneous users.


This revised roadmap not only clarifies our vision but also establishes clear criteria for success—ensuring every phase of development is aligned with both user needs and quality standards.
